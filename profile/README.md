Just getting this out of the way, the reason why this organization is called "snap-snapblocks" is because "snapblocks" was already taken.
# Snapblocks
Snapblocks is a fork of [scratchblocks](https://github.com/scratchblocks/scratchblocks) that is more catered towards Snap! This is the place where snapblocks is, as well as some snapblocks plugins for mediawiki, discourse, and others will be.
